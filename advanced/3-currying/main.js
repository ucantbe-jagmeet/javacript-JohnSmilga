// Function Currying

// currying is a process in functional programming in which we transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions that take one argument at a time;

// function f( a, b, c) is transformed to f(a)(b)(c)

// When a function , instead of taking all arguments at one time , takes the first one and return a new function that takes the second one and returns a new functions
